Section 14, Lecture 136





Imagine a tollbooth at a bridge. Cars passing by the booth are expected to pay a 50 cent toll. Mostly they do, but sometimes a car goes by without paying. The tollbooth keeps track of the number of cars that have gone by, and of the total amount of money collected.
      Model this tollbooth with a class called tollBooth. The two data items are a type unsigned int to hold the total number of cars, and a          type double to hold the total amount of money collected. A constructor initializes both of these to 0. A member function called                    payingCar() increments the car total and adds 0.50 to the cash total. Another function, called nopayCar(), increments the car total            but adds nothing to the cash total. Finally, a member function called display() displays the two totals. Make appropriate member                functions const.

      Include a program to test this class. This program should allow the user to push one (1) key to count a paying car, and another say            0 to count a nonpaying car. Pushing the Esc key should cause the program to print out the total cars and total cash and then exit.









2.  Create a class called time that has separate int member data for hours, minutes, and seconds. One constructor should initialize this           data to 0, and another should initialize it to fixed values. Another member function should display it, in 11:59:59 format. The final                 member function should add two objects of type time passed as arguments.

     A main() program should create two initialized time objects (should they be const?) and one that isnâ€™t initialized. Then it should add           the two initialized values together, leaving the result in the third time variable. Finally it should display the value of this third                         variable.Make appropriate member functions const.
